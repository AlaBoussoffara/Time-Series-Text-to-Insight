Database context for SQL agent
--------------------------------
Use this schema summary when deciding how to generate SQL queries against the operational PostgreSQL database that powers the project. Projects contain multiple sites; each site can host several gateways; gateways receive configuration records that define the data feeds they ingest, and the resulting measurements are stored in the raw time-series table.

projects
- Description: High-level metadata for each monitoring project, including client, geography, and schedule fields.
- project_id integer primary key
- name text
- country text
- client_company_name text
- time_zone text
- city text
- start_date text
- description text

sites  (project-level locations)
- Description: Physical or logical locations tied to projects; includes lifecycle timestamps and status indicators used for reporting.
- site_id integer primary key
- name text
- type text
- extent text
- start_date text
- previsional_end text
- project_id integer references projects(project_id)
- created_at text
- updated_at text
- deleted boolean
- operating_rate double precision
- main_site integer

gateways  (hardware relaying measurements)
- Description: Field gateways that forward sensor data to the platform, with operational metadata such as power supply, coordinates, and provider.
- gateway_id integer primary key
- name text
- serial_number text
- transfer_protocol text
- power_supply text
- installation_date text
- operating_team text
- x double precision
- y double precision
- z double precision
- time_zone text
- geom text
- created_at text
- updated_at text
- provider integer

configs  (ingestion settings per gateway)
- Description: Gateway-specific ingestion definitions covering file names, transport settings, and structured payloads that describe expected variables.
- config_id integer primary key
- file_name text
- last_treatment text
- ftp text
- ftp_ip text
- ftp_user text
- ftp_password text
- ftp_directory text
- payload text
- gateway_id integer references gateways(gateway_id)
- parsing_id integer
- file_id integer
- to_move text
- regex_variables text
- created_at text
- updated_at text
- active boolean
- error_message text
- last_modified text
- keep_folder boolean

site_gateways  (site â†” gateway junction)
- Description: Many-to-many bridge linking sites to the gateways installed there; use to traverse from projects to the associated hardware.
- site_id integer references sites(site_id)
- gateway_id integer references gateways(gateway_id)
- primary key (site_id, gateway_id)

raw_measurements  (time-series facts)
- Description: Sensor readings ingested from the gateways; combine with gateway metadata on `gateway_name = gateways.name` and relate to configuration payload details via `variable_alias` and `variable_id` when interpreting variables.
- gateway_name text
- variable_name text
- variable_alias text
- sensor_id integer
- value double precision
- timestamp text
- variable_id integer
- unit text
- metric text
